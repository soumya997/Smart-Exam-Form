# Problem Statement:
Hand grading an answer sheet consumes lots of time and as every thing is going vertual/online exams are happening in online mode too. By taking that into consideration we have created an web-app for grading an Essay type question(questions for 10-60 marks) automatically using NLP. We are trying to make a plateform using which a teacher can create a exam form according to their choice(they can add different MCQ,essay questions in their Exam form) and students will be able to use that form for submitting their answers and By the help of Smart-Exam-Form they will get their score .
